# Try / Except / Finally

`finally`Â  executes no matter what happens.

It is used to clean up anything that was created for the purpose of the test.

It will run even if you call `exit()` in the `try` block.

```
try:
    x = 10/0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(e)
    exit(0)
finally:
    print("finally")
```

```
division by zero
finally
```
